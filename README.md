# NN_Prototype
NN construction for learning simple functions by given dataset. Contains config-file loading structrure, informations how to setup your own config file -> "config structure.cfg" . PLEASE READ IT FIRST, it will give some important information about the config.

The project also contains some simple test where no test data are necessary because you can write them very easy.
And also contain a full example look at the train.norm and test.norm files (parabolic function).

Its my very own and also my 1st implementation of an ANN so please ignore the low performance or update the content as you like.
Have some fun with it.

Cheers Brainiac
